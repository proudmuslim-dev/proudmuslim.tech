# Replace

- [**Canalex's Keystrokes with Sk1er's**](https://sk1er.club/mods/keystrokesmod)
  - Old and no longer maintained. Sk1er's will continue to receive updates once ModCore 2 is released.
- [**spiderfrog's old animations with Sk1er's**](https://sk1er.club/beta)
  - Spiderfrog's OAM causes many issues with other mods, is bloated, and causes crashes. Sk1er's is more accurate to 1.7 and has better compatibility and no bloat.

# Remove

- **ModCore Container**
  - Modcore Container was a mod meant to give players ModCore before it was packaged in mods that needed it. It is now useless and could cause issues when ModCore 2 comes out.
- **Player API**
  - Player API is no longer used in any mods.
- **AutoWho**
  - Hypixel removed AutoWho's core functionality a few years ago.
- **Skypixel**
  - Skypixel is old, not maintained, and has many features that are either useless, or simply do not work anymore.
- [**LabyMod**](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/Alternatives/blob/main/LabyMod.md)
  - LabyMod causes many issues with other mods, and has many alternatives that can be used without messing up other mods.
- [**SkyblockExtras**](https://github.com/MicrocontrollersDev/Alternatives/blob/main/SkyblockExtras.md) (if you bought it)
  - SBE breaks EULA, breaks some licenses, leads to poor FPS, and has much better free alternatives for all of its important features.

| [**Skytils**](https://github.com/Skytils/SkytilsMod/releases) | Even more cool stuff, including but not limited to puzzle solvers and diana/relic waypoints: [**List of features**](https://github.com/Skytils/SkytilsMod/blob/main/README.md) | [Sychic](https://github.com/Sychic) and [Lily](https://github.com/My-Name-Is-Jeff) |

| [**SkyblockAddons**](https://biscuit.codes/mods/skyblockaddons/downloadversion/?v=1.5.5) | You know what this is. | [Biscuit](https://biscuit.codes/) |
| [**Cowlection**](https://github.com/cow-mc/Cowlection/releases) | Has some miniscule features, but they're cool nonetheless: [**List of features**]( https://github.com/cow-mc/Cowlection/blob/master/README.md) | [Cow](https://github.com/cow-mc/) |

Note: It is not recommended that you use SkyblockCatia either since that mod has a bunch of incompatibilities with other mods and has a bunch of features that aren't even for skyblock, making it a very bloated mod.

# Reasons NOT to Buy SBE:
- [**Poor puzzle solvers**](https://i.imgur.com/zXydj0j.png)
- [**Poor features v1**](https://i.imgur.com/T3V8kDQ.png)
- [**Poor features v2**](https://i.imgur.com/mFdaV2n.png)
- [**Obfuscated**](https://i.imgur.com/r5RROwf.png)
    - Context: This means we cant read the code unless we spend hours decrpyting it. This makes the mod very unsafe as it could be doing anything behind the user's back. It also spams the user's logs and is used to hide stolen code.
- [**Compatibility issues**](https://i.imgur.com/RA2gUpf.png)
- **Use pirated software to protect against piracy**
- [**Spams your logs v1**](https://i.imgur.com/1jRDyni.png)
- [**Spams your logs v2**](https://i.imgur.com/WwTWzrI.png)
- [**Spams your logs v3**](https://i.imgur.com/ExwvQrU.png)
- [**Spams your logs v4**](https://i.imgur.com/nIVikWF.png)
- **Blatantly steals from DSM** (can't find screenshot but its the tic tac toe solver, it's literally the same thing)
- [**Blatantly steals from SBC**](https://i.imgur.com/n7T9DkB.png)
- [**Blatantly steals from Patcher**](https://hst.sh/xetawopini.java)
    - Context: When patcher 1.5 was in beta and 1.12 crop hitboxes were added, they were bugged and broken. When Complex "made" his version, he somehow managed to produce the [exact same bug](https://i.imgur.com/1Ir8zjS.png). Then Moulberry came in and fixed the glitch, and not soon after, Complex also supposedly "found out" how to fix it.
- [**Blatantly steals from NEU**](https://i.imgur.com/nNJp8bD.png)
    - Context: NEU had originally made a feature that allowed you to retexture skulls with custom models. On the SBE discord, they had specifically stated that they will not be stealing features from other mods and people should not request them to add stolen features. At the time Moulberry was pretty annoyed at SBE for blatantly stealing features and was saying on stream he was going to add dungeon puzzle solvers to make SBE useless which was when they put out that statement, but when Moulberry decided against dungeon puzzle solvers, they went straight back to stealing.
- **Blatantly steals from Skytils**
    - Added necron phase timers literally the day after Skytils. Complex also admitted to stalking the Skytils [github repository](https://github.com/Skytils/SkytilsMod).
- [**Breaks MC EULA**](https://i.imgur.com/SyNXc9W.png)
    - Mojang can take down the mod at any time and you'd lose $5. And no, calling it a "donation to Complex" doesn't change anything in the eyes of the law. The mod is advertised as paid, and is unlocked with money.
- [**Performance issues**](https://i.imgur.com/8sYs8bg.png), and [**even more performance issues**](https://i.imgur.com/bxJyO2X.png)
    - SBE is notorious for destroying your FPS. Their attempt at fixing it was blatantly stealing patcher fps features.
- Poorly coded and can cause a huge config file

    - [Picture 3](https://i.imgur.com/rOSAvgG.png)
- **Complex and AlphaElite are not good people**
    - Illegally steal other people's work.
    - [Lie about other mods stealing from them](https://i.imgur.com/L7ilxLS.png).
    - Are rude to other mod developers.
- **Rude staff**

# Even if you already bought SBE, do NOT use it!
If you already did buy it, the Sunk Cost Fallacy makes it so that you still shouldn't use it. The money you spent is already long gone and no longer plays a factor in your decision making. Using the $5 as an excuse to continue using SBE is the irrational decision. Think of it as buying a broken spoon that barely works, and then finding a brand new working one in your drawer. There is no reason to continue using the broken spoon. Even if you do use it, you're not getting your money's worth out of it. That money was thrown away and nothing can be done about it. Same applies for SBE. Your money is gone. Remove SBE from your device.
